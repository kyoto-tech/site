# Kyoto Tech Meetup Website

This repository holds the Astro-powered marketing site for the Kyoto Tech Meetup community.

Everything here is maintained by community members; contributions that make the experience clearer, more accessible, or easier to maintain are welcome.

## Tech Stack

- [Astro 5](https://astro.build/) with React islands for dynamic UI.
- [Tailwind CSS 4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling plus a small layer of global CSS.
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering Markdown copy inside Astro components.
- ESLint (flat config), TypeScript, Knip, and Astro Check keep the project tidy.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the local dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:4321` to view the site. Astro enables hot module replacement, so edits appear immediately.

3. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

## Useful Scripts

## Contributing

1. Fork or clone the repo, then branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and commit on your branch.
3. Before submitting a pull request:
    1. Ensure your local branch is up to date with `main`.
    2. Run `npm run check` to ensure lint, type, and Astro diagnostics all pass.
4. Push your branch to the remote repository.
5. Open a pull request, describing what you changed.
6. Request a review.

## Ideas for Contributions

- Expand homepage content (additional recurring events, partner highlights, FAQs).
- Build an email newsletter signup form.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labeling, color contrast, keyboard navigation checks).
- Add tests or visual regression tooling for future redesigns.
- Internationalization or localization improvements for Japanese/English visitors.

## Deployment

- The site is deployed automatically to [GitHub Pages](https://kyoto-tech.github.io) via the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- Any push to `main` triggers `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and then publishes the `dist/` directory using `actions/deploy-pages`.
- To test a production build locally, use `npm run build && npm run preview`.
